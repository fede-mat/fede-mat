# Hi there, I'm Federico Riva ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm currently a master's student in **Computational Science and Computational Learning** at Politecnico di Milano with a deep interest in numerical methods, stochastic models, and data-driven analysis. 

I completed my Bachelor's in **Mathematical Engineering** with an elective thesis under the supervision of Professor Marco Verani focused on **SVD Factorization**, **Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)**, and their application to the **SEIRD model** for epidemic modeling.

## Current Projects
- **Markov Chain Analysis of Bond Ratings**: Using MATLAB and Python to analyze the stochastic evolution of bond ratings.

## Skills
- **Languages**: Python, MATLAB, LaTeX, R
- **Key Interests**: Numerical methods, Stochastic modeling, Machine learning, Data analysis
